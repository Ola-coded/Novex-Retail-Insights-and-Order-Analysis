This analysis represents my 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐓𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐮, and it was created to understand how Novex Retail has performed over time and what the future might look like. Rather than focusing only on past results, this analysis combines 𝐡𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠, helping to tell a complete business story; where the company has been, where it is now, and where it may be heading next.

The analysis begins by looking at the overall health of the business. Novex Retail recorded 𝐭𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 $2,297,200, which shows consistent commercial activity across customers, products, and regions. Key summary indicators highlight important business drivers such as the 𝐛𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫, 𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭, 𝐡𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐢𝐭𝐲, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐛𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧. These metrics immediately set the context for deeper exploration.

When sales are examined by year, a clear pattern begins to emerge. The business experienced a slight decline around 2015, followed by a steady recovery and growth between 2016 𝐚𝐧𝐝 2018. This period reflects improved performance and increasing customer demand.
By 2019, sales begin to soften again, suggesting the business may be approaching a turning point. This historical trend is important because it helps explain why forecasting is necessary; to anticipate future performance rather than react to it.

One of the most important parts of this analysis is the 𝐭𝐰𝐨-𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐭. Using historical order data, Tableau projects future sales trends to show what may happen if current patterns continue.
The forecast suggests that:
•	Sales are expected to 𝐟𝐥𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧 𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐰 𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐥𝐲
•	There is a 𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐤 𝐨𝐟 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 if no strategic action is taken
•	Future performance is uncertain, highlighting the need for proactive planning

This forecasting insight transforms the dashboard from a simple historical report into a 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐝-𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐨𝐨𝐥, allowing the business to prepare for potential challenges and opportunities ahead.

The analysis shows that 𝐚 𝐬𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐚 𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐟𝐢𝐭. 𝐓𝐚𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐚 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐝 stands out as the most profitable customer, followed by others such as Cindy Stewart and Raymond Buch.
This indicates that Novex Retail relies heavily on high-value customers, making 𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩 𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 critical to future success.

From a product perspective, the 𝐂𝐚𝐧𝐨𝐧 𝐈𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐂𝐋𝐀𝐒𝐒 2200 𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐨𝐩𝐢𝐞𝐫 clearly generates the highest profit. Other products contribute meaningfully but do not perform at the same level.
This insight helps identify:
•	Products that should be prioritized in sales and marketing
•	Items that may require re-evaluation or repositioning
•	Opportunities to bundle or promote lower-performing products

Sales by region reveal that the 𝐖𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧 is the strongest performer, with 𝐍𝐞𝐰 𝐘𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐂𝐢𝐭𝐲 emerging as the highest-profit-generating city. This indicates strong market penetration in specific geographic areas.
Understanding regional performance allows the business to:
•	Replicate successful strategies in other regions
•	Allocate resources more effectively
•	Focus expansion efforts where demand is proven

•	Novex Retail shows 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐡𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞, but recent trends indicate potential slowing.
•	Forecasting reveals 𝐟𝐮𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐲, emphasizing the need for strategic action.
•	A small group of customers drives a large share of profits.
•	Certain products and regions significantly outperform others.
